##  Dataset Overview
- Total rows: 52,120  
- Columns:  
  - `brand_name` → Name of the brand  
  - `pants_description` → Product details  
  - `price` → Selling price  
  - `MRP` → Original price  
  - `discount_percent` → Discount applied  
  - `ratings` → Average customer rating  
  - `number_of_ratings` → Number of customers who rated  

##  SQL Queries Performed
We wrote SQL queries to find:  
1. **Total products per brand** → To see which brands dominate the catalog.  
2. **Average price per brand** → To understand pricing trends.  
3. **Top 10 products by ratings** → To highlight the best-rated products.  
4. **Average discount per brand** → To check which brands give the highest offers.

1. Top 10 Brands by Products  
2. Top 10 Brands by Average Price  
3. Top 10 Products by Ratings  
4. Top 10 Brands by Discounts
